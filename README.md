# Strapi starters & templates

Monorepo for all official Strapi v4 starters and templates.

### Starters

> As you may have [noticed](https://github.com/strapi/starters-and-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+install), a lot of the Starters are out of date and given constraints in bandwidth and other priorities, we've decided to sunset all Starters and only actively maintain a single Next.js Starter.
